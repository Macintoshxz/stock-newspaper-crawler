My first respository on GitHub!
I (have to) love :coffee:. More concretely, it's the first step (crawl corpus from 163.com) of LDA model(one of topic models).
This little project is about the fundamentals of natural language processing, mainly concentrating on Chinese word count,
word frequency statistic and etc. The module of Chinese word count is accomplished by MM(Maximum Matching) method
and RMM(Reverse Maximum Matching) method.
